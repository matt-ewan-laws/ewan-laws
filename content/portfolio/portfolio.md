This site is build using the Rust based static site generator [Zola](https://www.getzola.org), and hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

The rationale behind this stack is that it provides a good comprimise between editability (content is in the from of markdown files), and ease of hosting (the output is a static website).

_Why not Hugo?_

Hugo is better supported and more feature rich, however Zola is simpler and the documentation is more concise. Getting up and running quickly won it for me.
