Although I get excited by the cutting edge technologies and what they can bring, for production systems I recognise the importance of reliable, tried and tested libraries, frameworks, and platforms.

Picking the right tool for the job will save huge amounts of development work. So I always try to spend the time looking at the technical requirements of a project and weighing up the possible choices and design decisions that in no small way influences the development process.
